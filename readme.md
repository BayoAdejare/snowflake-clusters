# Evaluating Snowflake Micro-Partitioning Schemes

Looking at Snowflake built-in paritioning scheme, "micro-partition".
In relation to the cluster key construct. Here I load 5 different 
tables definitions, the variations been on the cluster key defined.
I then use system functions to investigate the impact of the partitions
and cluster keys.
